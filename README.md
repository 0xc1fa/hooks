This repository contains a curated selection of React hooks that I personally used for enhanced project functionality. It is regularly updated with new tools.

## Available Hooks

- `useAudioSourceLoader`: Manages the setting and reloading of audio sources in a `HTMLAudioElement`.
- `useEventListener`: Adds event listeners to the window or any DOM element.
- `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect`: Uses useEffect server-side and useLayoutEffect client-side for optimal rendering.
- `useObjectURL`: Creates object URLs from a Blob or MediaSource and manages their lifecycle.
- `useSmoothTimeUpdate`: Ensures smooth and continuous dispatch of `timeupdate` events in an `HTMLAudioElement` or `HTMLVideoElement` by utilizing animation frames.
